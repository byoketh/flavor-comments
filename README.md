# flavor-comments
These are some funny (I think) comments I often leave at the bottom files that I write

- if this comment is removed the program will blow up
- i'm sorry
- magic. do not tamper.
- sometimes i think the compiler just ignores all my comments
- print("written by richie") if working else print("i have no idea who wrote this")
